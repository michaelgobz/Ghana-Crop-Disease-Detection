# Ghana-Crop-Disease-Detection
The objective of this challenge is to develop robust machine learning models that can accurately predict all diseases present in images of corn, pepper, and tomato crops. Participants are tasked with creating models that can a) generalise well, even when encountering new diseases not seen in the training set,
